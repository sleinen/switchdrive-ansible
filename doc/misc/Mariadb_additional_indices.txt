The default set of indices that owncloud ships with proved not to be good enough.
We added a few indices ourselves.


#############
# how to find which additional indices might be useful:

The slow queries log is located at:
      /mnt/data/mariadb/mysql-slow.log

# by default queries not using indices are not logged. so turn that on:

set global log_queries_not_using_indexes=on;

# to turn it off again:
set global log_queries_not_using_indexes=off;

# to list the indices on a table, e.g. type:
show index from oc_users;


SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEX_STATISTICS WHERE TABLE_NAME = "author";


indices added to owncloud db
============================

create index file_target_index on oc_share (file_target);
create index uid_owner_index on oc_share (uid_owner);
create index share_with_index on oc_share (share_with);

create index uid_index on oc_group_user(uid);
create index argument_index on oc_jobs(argument);

Added 30 August 2017, and allowed us to reduce from 6 to 3 DB
CREATE INDEX share_with_index ON oc_share (share_with);
